# Capstone-Elementopia
Capstone Project
# 1. Introduction
Elementopia is a standalone web application, developed using React.js for the frontend and SpringBoot for the backend, with MySQL as the database. It will be hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure, allowing high availability and scalability. The platform offers a unique blend of education and entertainment by integrating game mechanics into the learning process.
# 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the "Elementopia" gamified learning platform for chemistry. It outlines the system's functional and non-functional requirements, design constraints, and provides an overview of the project for stakeholders, developers, and testers.
# 1.2 Scope
Elementopia is an interactive, gamified platform designed to enhance high school students' learning experience in chemistry. The platform allows students to combine elements to form compounds, visualize reactions, and complete chemistry-related challenges through game mechanics like rewards and progression levels. It aims to increase engagement and retention of chemistry concepts among students and provide teachers with a tool to monitor student progress.

# Implementation
1. Run "**git clone https://github.com/mellowieee/Capstone-Elementopia.git**" on your command prompt on your chosen local directory.
2. TYPE on your command prompt or your terminal in your IDE the following code to **change directory**, "**cd FRONTEND**".
3. TYPE on your command prompt or your terminal in your IDE the following code to download dependencies, "**npm install**".
4. TYPE "**npm run dev**" in the terminal to start the application.


Note: For the IDE's, We are using VSCode for Frontend and Intellij for Backend. However, you can always use your preffered IDE.
